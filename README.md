## 💻 A Little About Me
  I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Data Science at the University of Arizona, with a deep-rooted fascination for deep learning and the inner workings of artificial intelligence. While others see black-box models, I see a canvas where we teach machines to mimic the marvels of the human brain. I’m particularly driven by the challenge of building systems that learn, adapt, and evolve — just like we do. Whether it’s neural networks, generative AI, or cutting-edge research, I love diving into the world where math meets creativity.
  I enjoy working across the stack — from frontend frameworks and backend APIs to model deployment and data pipelines — which allows me to bridge the gap between robust machine learning systems and real-world applications.

Outside of academics, I’m a tech enthusiast at heart — always exploring new tools, frameworks, and ideas to push the boundaries of what’s possible. I’m excited to contribute to projects that not only solve problems but also inspire innovation. Let’s build something impactful together.
